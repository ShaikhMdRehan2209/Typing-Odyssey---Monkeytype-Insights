# Typing-Odyssey---Monkeytype-Insights
This project visualizes and analyzes my personal typing performance data from Monkeytype. Monkeytype allows users to download their typing history as a CSV file.  I cleaned, processed, and visualized the data to extract insights on performance trends, accuracy, error types, and personal bests.
